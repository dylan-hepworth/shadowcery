# SHADOWCERY
## A jQuery plugin for making ridiculous shadows
Shadowcery adds layered box-shadows to dom elements and animates them into view.

Simply add jquery.shadowcery.js or jquery.shadowcery.min.js to your website (make sure jQuery is in place of course).

In order to add shadows to an object, add the following:

```
$('.shadow').shadowcery();
```

### Options:
color: Sets the color of the shadow
opacity: Sets the opacity value from 0 to 1
length: The total length of the shadow
delay: The amount of time you'd like to delay the shadow from animating
vertical: Sets the vertical direction of the shadow
horizontal: Set the horizontal direction of the shadow
blur: Amount of blur
